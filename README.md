============

Did you ever want to get Steve (or Alex) blackout drunk, stoned, high on crack
or perhaps tripping on shrooms? No? Well, I've got the perfect mod fo... Wait a minute...

Anyway, this mod allows you to do all these things. It utilizes shaders and is
thus able to accomplish a party of colors and effects you may not have seen before.
You (most likely) won't be disappointed.
